Playing around with the package.json provided by johnathanconway today as a base for react.

## Plan: 
1) scaffold facebook create react app in a seperate folder. 
2) move the files but not node_modules or package.json.
3) get the thing to work.
4) get the first test to pass. 
5) maybe write some tests or button up to make most stable.
6) change folder/file structure to something I prefer.

7) potentially, link up redux
